# Description
Welcome to the Dad Joke Generator Web App! This simple web application fetches jokes from the Dad Jokes API and displays them when the user clicks a button.

# Features 
- Fetches jokes from the Dad Jokes API.
- Displays a new joke each time the user clicks the "Get a 
  Joke" button.

# Files
- index.html: The main HTML file for the web app.
- styles.css: Contains the CSS styles for the web page.
- script.js: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching and 
  displaying jokes.

 # How It Works
   The app uses JavaScript to make a fetch request to the 
   Dad Jokes API. When the user clicks the "Get a Joke" 
   button, a request is sent to the API, and the response
   (a random dad joke) is displayed on the web page.
